## Rules
By messaging on our server you accept to follow the rules:
1. Be nice, respectful and kind to others. In no way should you purposefully offend or harass other members.
2. Refrain from often use of strong language.
3. Don't mention other members frequently.
3. Mention Moderators only if it is necessary.
4. Do not post NSFW content, even if it is censored.
5. Do not spam or flood.

Violations from these rules may lead to timing you out or, in case of very severe violations, banning you.
## Guidelines
There's a list of recommendations we want to give you before you start messaging on the server. You can find it [here](<https://github.com/Smash-Hit-Lab/discord-server-terms/blob/main/guidelines.md>). This list may expand in the future so we also recommend you reread it sometimes.
