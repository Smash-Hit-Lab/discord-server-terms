# Discord Server Guidelines

- Don't use rich text (*italic*, **bold**, ~~strikeout~~, etc.) excessively.
  It may look out of place and/or look overused.
- If you want to ask a question, just ask! No need to ping anyone or ask if you
  can ask a question.
- Don't ask for mod links *stubbornly*. An artist may not want to publish their
  work which is absolutely normal so we recommend you to stop asking about it
  just after the first "no" to not annoy anyone.
- Don't rate someone else's work on a number scale and/or ask someone to rate
  yours like this. It doesn't give you any points on how to make the work
  better.
- If you happen to take part in an argument, act in good faith and try to
  understand your opponents points.
- Don't plagiarize someone else's work nor use it in your own work without
  original author's consent, even if you give them credit. It's *their* work
  and it's for them to decide if it can be in yours. Plagiarism doesn't give
  you any skills and it can ruin original work's or your work's reputation.
- Put angle brackets (greater-than `<` and less-than `>`) around links that
  make huge preview embeds to make Discord hide the embeds.
- Don't give too much advice, especially if you weren't asked for it in the
  first place.
